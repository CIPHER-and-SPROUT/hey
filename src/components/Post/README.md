## WiW3 #7DaysofLensProtocol Cohort notes, by @cuddleofDeath

This README is meant to be more of like an overall comment of how I would go about implementing goal setting.

# Step(s) to accomplish this: Rework (or clone) the Post module to create our Goal module.

- For this, I started with the NewPost module originally. I feel like this can be repurposed as a NewGoal module. I changed the placeholder text to "What's your goal?"

Ideally, they need to be able to post their goal in order to garner support from the community.
